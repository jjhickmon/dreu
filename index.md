## About Me

I am broadly interested in Computer Vision, and Embodied AI; however, my specific interests include Multimodal Machine Learning and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning.

My goal is to utilize multiple modalities in order to create systems that can truly understand the semantics of our world and can effectively use this semantic knowledge in real-world interaction and prediction.

When I'm not at the computer, you can find me playing guitar, skate boarding, rock climbing, or simply running around Hyrule!
