## About Me

I am broadly interested in Computer Vision, and Embodied AI; however, my specific interests include Multimodal Machine Learning and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning.

My goal is to utilize multiple modalities in order to create systems that can truly understand the semantics of our world and can effectively use this semantic knowledge in real-world interaction and prediction.

When I'm not at the computer, you can find me playing guitar, skate boarding, rock climbing, or simply running around Hyrule!

## About My Mentor

Dr. Peleg currently focuses on how organisms adapt to environmental fluctuations. A major area of her research concerns honeybee clusters as she dissects how bees create a stable structure in the presence of mechanical stress. She also investigates signaling between animals, specifically the methods animals employ to amplify and interpret signals across large space and time scales. To solve this problem, Dr. Peleg uses honeybees, plants, and fireflies as model organisms. In addition, Dr. Peleg models movement ecology to demonstrate how animals translocate food over long distances. This behavior requires interplay between navigation and assessment of the environment to establish the optimal path in terms of accuracy, speed, and effort. Through several diverse projects, Dr. Peleg harnesses the power of computational tools to answer fundamental questions in biology and ecology.
