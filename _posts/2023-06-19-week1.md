title: Week 1

The first week I primarily read the relevant literature surrounding my project. There was a significant body of work surrounding the pathfinding capabilities of honeybees, so I read 4 papers and 1 book to learn about these topics. Overall the readings made sense and were thoroughly interesting, although I had one major question regarding the lighting setup for the experiments. The papers I read utilized a backlit system, which would be less than ideal when utilizing computer vision to distinguish the bees. Lucklily, a quick meeting with Dr. Peleg informed me that recent work has modified this lighting system to better identify features of individual bees. I had a few questions about the specific experiments that were conducted; however, I will be meeting with Golnar Fard during week 2 to discuss these questions in more detail.
