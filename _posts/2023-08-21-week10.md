title: Week 10

This week I sucessfully rewrote the bee tracking/segmentation software in python and integrated the code into the existing system. I was able to reduce the label switching issue when bees were clustered; however, I had a few more ideas on how to solve this issue. After speaking with Dr. Peleg, she and I agreed that I could continue working on the project, even though the DREU program was technically over. I just learned that I was accepted to present my summer research at the 2023 NDiSTEM Conference, so Dr. Peleg and I will continue working on the project until then so we can have good results.
