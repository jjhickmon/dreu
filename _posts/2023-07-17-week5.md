This week I was running tests with the BIO software to track the positions of the honeybees. I was able to figure out the most common points of failure for the system. The most prominent of which was when the bees were clustered together, the system would often swap the labels of the bees. I also ran a few demo tests with the existing CollectiveScentingCV code to understand how to classify the behavior of the honeybees as "scenting" or "non-scenting." Together Dr. Peleg and I decided that we should spend a bit more time attempting to reduce the clustering issues; however, if we couldn't find a solution within two weeks then we would move on.

Along with this work, I submitted an abstract to the SACNAS NDiSTEM conference where I aim to present the research I conducted during this summer. Finally, I learned that I was accepted into the BS/MS program at the University of Washington! This will be a major step towards achieving my research and career goals.
