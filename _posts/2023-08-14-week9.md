title: Week 9
---

I had been having issues getting the BIO software to run on my MAC so I spent this week debugging the software and allowing it to run on MacOS. Along with this, I realized I knew how to recreate a majority of the system using OpenCV and python, so I spoke with Dr. Peleg about rewriting the entire system so it would work better with our existing tools. She was in support of the idea, as long as I could do it within a reasonable amount of time, so I worked on rewriting the system through week 10.
