This week I worked on a few different tasks. I continued to try resolving the clustering issues with the BIO system; however, along with this I created a script to translate the position/state data exported from the BIO system, into a format for the existing CollectiveScentingCV system. After creating this script, both systems could communicate and we had a complete pipleline.
